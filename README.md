# 🌱 AgriConnect Marketplace  

AgriConnect is a **full-stack digital marketplace** that revolutionizes agricultural commerce by connecting **farmers directly with consumers and investors**. The platform ensures farmers retain maximum profits while enabling consumers and firms to **adopt or rent farmland**, creating a transparent, sustainable, and profitable agri-ecosystem.  

A standout feature is **“Adopt-a-Crop & Land Leasing”**, where farmers can rent their land, and consumers (individuals or firms) can adopt farmland. At harvest, participants share the capital returns along with produce — turning farming into a personal, engaging, and rewarding experience.
